# Classification-of-Mangrove-Species-Based-on-Leaf-Image-by-Implementing-Deep-Learning-using-Convolutional-Neural_Network-Algorithm

This project was created as a final project for the subject of "Advanced Topics of Data Science" during my Bachelor's at Universitas Sam Ratulangi.

Classification is carried out by implementing Deep Learning using the Convolutional Neural Network algorithm

The system achieved the classification accuracies in the range of 86.3% to 99.0%, indicating that the model is quite good.
